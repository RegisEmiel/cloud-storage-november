COSELAâ„¢ (trilaciclib) is administered prior to chemotherapy to help protect ES-SCLC
patients against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. The Pivotal Study compared
an etoposide/carboplatin + atezolizumab (E/P/A) regimen with COSELA vs without COSELA
based on endpoints across multiple lineages, including:
Incidence and duration of severe neutropenia (primary endpoints)
Incidence of Grade 3/4 anemia and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (secondary endpoints)
Rate of chemotherapy dose reductions (secondary endpoint)
